These are the policies that are to be attached to the Role that executes the lambda.

The AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole should be auto-generated when creating the Lambda, but I thought I'd add it here anyway. 

Add the HighScoreMemoryCardGAmeReadWriteDynamoDB policy to the same role that AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole is attached to.
